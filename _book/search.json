Besides that, this booklet is my notebook to write-down my notes about the course and the forecasting in general.\nIn summary, while the booklet is supposed to be oriented around the EdX course of IMF, it won’t remain limited to the course, as wandering is an essential part of the learning and an absolute joy!\nLet’s get started"
